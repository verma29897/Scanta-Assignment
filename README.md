# Scanta-Assignment
Data Analysis
The Data is generated by sensors of an automobile engine. You will find following 4 readings kept in separate json files:
•	Voltage (V)
•	Current (A)
•	Speed (km/h)
•	Odometer (km)
Each reading has two fields, timestamp (UNIX) and value of the reading:
{
time: 1511512585495,
value: 12
}

The Task
Your task is to write a program to store the data in a suitable way to a suitable database. In addition, based on the data, calculate the power output over time and the energy used over time by the vehicle.
The power is:		power = voltage * current 
The unit is watt.
Energy is the time-integrated power. For each new power measurement the energy contribution delta_energy can be approximated as:
delta_energy = previously_measured_power * delta_time
where delta_time is the time since the previous power measurement. We want the energy in units of kWh.
To be very explicit; we want a new power and energy value for every change in current and/or voltage.
As you are going to present your solution (explaining your choices and convincing us that the data is correctly handled), you also need to display the data somehow. This is not a frontend assignment, so some static plots are fine.

You Need to follow best python coding practices; clean and readable codes will get brownie points.
Plots should be self-explanatory.
